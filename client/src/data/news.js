        content: `CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  — NASA’s new moon rocket remained on track to blast off on a crucial test flight Monday, despite a series of lightning strikes at the launch pad.

        The 322-foot Space Launch System rocket is the most powerful ever built by NASA. It’s poised to send an empty crew capsule into lunar orbit, a half-century after NASA’s Apollo program, which landed 12 astronauts on the moon.
        
        Astronauts could return to the moon in a few years, if this six-week test flight goes well. NASA officials caution, however, that the risks are high and the flight could be cut short.
        
        In lieu of astronauts, three test dummies are strapped into the Orion capsule to measure vibration, acceleration and radiation, one of the biggest hazards to humans in deep space. The capsule alone has more than 1,000 sensors.
        
        Officials said Sunday that neither the rocket nor capsule suffered any damage during Saturday’s thunderstorm; ground equipment also was unaffected. Five strikes were confirmed, hitting the 600-foot (183-meter) lightning-protection towers surrounding the rocket at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. The strikes weren’t strong enough to warrant major retesting.
        
        “Clearly, the system worked as designed,” said Jeff Spaulding, NASA’s senior test director.
        
        More storms were expected. Although forecasters gave 80% odds of acceptable weather Monday morning, conditions were expected to deteriorate during the two-hour launch window.
        
        On the technical side, Spaulding said the team did its best over the past several months to eliminate any lingering fuel leaks. A pair of countdown tests earlier this year prompted repairs to leaking valves and other faulty equipment; engineers won’t know if all the fixes are good until just a few hours before the planned liftoff. If Monday doesn’t pan out, the next launch attempt would be Friday.`,

        content: `It took less than 50 minutes for firefighters on the ground and in the air to put out a 10-acre brushfire along the Ronald Reagan (118) Freeway in Chatsworth on Saturday afternoon.

        The fire was reported at 3:31 p.m. along the westbound 118 Freeway at De Soto Avenue, described as one acre in light to medium brush, said the Los Angeles Fire Department’s Margaret Stewart.
        
        The fire was reported out at 4:18 p.m. and air resources were released, leaving firefighters on the ground to make sure to put out all hot spots, Stewart said. The burn area had grown to 10 acres.
        
        No structures were damaged, no evacuations were ordered and no injuries were reported, she said.
        
        The California Highway Patrol issued a SigAlert at about 3:30 p.m. shutting down the De Soto Avenue off-ramp from the westbound 118. It remained in effect during mop-up operations.`,

        content: `He was one of three Dutch soldiers, all in the US for training exercises, who were wounded in the shooting in the early hours of Saturday.

        According to the Dutch Defence Ministry the two other victims are conscious and remain in hospital in stable condition.
        
        Police believe the shooting followed an earlier disturbance in downtown Indianapolis, but gave few details.
        
        The city's law enforcement agencies are still investigating the shooting and have so far not reported any arrests. An earlier police statement said detectives did not believe it was a "random act".
        
        According to local media, the incident took place around 03:30 (07:30 GMT) on Saturday outside the Hampton Inn Hotel in the city's entertainment district, where the three soldiers had been staying.
        
        Officials believe the shooting followed a previous altercation including one or multiple other people at another location in the city.
        
        Dutch defence officials confirmed the soldiers had been off-duty at the time of the attack and that their families had been notified.
        
        All three of the soldiers were members of the Commando Corps, one of the special operations units in the Netherlands armed forces.
        
        According to AP news agency, the Indiana National Guard said the soldiers had been training at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center before visiting Indiana's state capital at the end of their duty day.
        
        As well as being used by the US Department of Defense, the Indiana military centre is used by the armed forces of the US's international allies for training purposes as well..
